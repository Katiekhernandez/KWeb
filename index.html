<pre><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Cooper Hernandez. He was adopted in May of 2019. He is 3 months old.
He is currently teething, so he loves chewing anything you put out in front of him. His favorite thing to do is chase after his siblings, Kookie and Zoey. He is in the process of potty training. He wakes his owners up at 4am, every day of the week, to go pee.   
Cooper has many skills, he can sit, lay down, and give handshakes, on command. We are currently working on getting Cooper to stay still.</p></pre>

<pre><p2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooper is occasionally outside, but sleeps indoor. He gets very happy to see his owners, when they get home from school or work. His siblings are inside dogs, so they prefer to stay inside. They also, don't chew everything like Cooper. </p></pre>
